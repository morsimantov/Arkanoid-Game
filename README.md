# Arkanoid-Game

## About
A Classic Arkanoid game, developed in Java Using a single thread. Also, there was no use in Java GUI Built-In objects, but a self-made GUI implementation.

## Compiling and Running
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine. Also, you can download the entire source code and run the game via any Java IDE.

## Game Instructions

### Goal: 

There are three levels. In each level, you need to hit all the blocks with the ball.

### Game Rules:

If the ball falls off, you lose one life. You have only 5 lives, so use them carefully!

There is a countdown before each level starts.

If you want to pause the game, press on the key 'p'.

Once you strike all the blocks on one level, you pass to another, more challenging one.

The score accumulates from one level to another. 

Once winning the last level, you win the game!
